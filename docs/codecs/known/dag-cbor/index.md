Codec: DAG-CBOR
===============

DAG-CBOR is a codec that implements the IPLD Data Model as a subset of CBOR,
plus some additional constraints for hash consistent representations.
DAG-CBOR also adds a "link" type using a CBOR tag, to bring it in line with the IPLD [Data Model](/glossary/#data-model).

DAG-CBOR is a codec we recommend using.
It has very complete mapping to the IPLD Data Model;
it's binary and length-delimited (meaning it's generally very effecient to parse);
and it's widely supported through the IPLD ecosystem.

See the [DAG-CBOR specifications](/specs/codecs/dag-cbor/) for details.


Quick Compare
-------------

#### interoperability

DAG-CBOR is based on CBOR, and CBOR libraries are already ubiquitous and can be found in many languages.
If you are working in a language that doesn't have IPLD libraries yet, you can use another CBOR library easily.

#### performance

_(Standard performance caveat: implementation details always matter; performance is always situational;
always do benchmarks before presuming serialization performance is a critical bottleneck; etc.)_

DAG-CBOR is typically considered to be fast.
It's a binary, length-prefixed format.  These traits usually associate with good performance.

(In length-prefixed formats, strings can be scanned quickly without escaping, and encoded without escaping;
allocations can be made up front; etc; all these things contribute to speed and efficiency.)

#### human-friendliness

DAG-CBOR is not very human friendly.
It's a binary, length-prefixed format.
While these traits contribute to its performance, they do not make it easy to edit.

You cannot typically write or edit DAG-CBOR by hand.

#### generality

DAG-CBOR supports the **full** IPLD [Data Model](/glossary/#data-model), completely losslessly.

### density

DAG-CBOR's density is roughly comparable to JSON.  E.g. If a series of maps have the same keys repeated,
then those keys will be repeated in the DAG-CBOR serial form.
