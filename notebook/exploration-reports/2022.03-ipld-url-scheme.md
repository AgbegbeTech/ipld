IPLD URL Scheme v0
==================

This is a proposed IPLD URL scheme spec, focusing on a minimal viable specification which doesn't address advanced use cases such as lenses or selectors.

tl;dr

```
GET ipld://bafy....etc/some/path => {some: data}
PUT ipld://bafy....etc/some/path {some: data} => ipld://bafy...etc/
```

## Objective

`ipfs://` exists out in the wild to provide ways to link to files, and some web browsers integrate IPFS URLs to load and author content.
This spec shows how a similar URL scheme can exist for IPLD data.
Part of the goal of the spec is to make it easy to reuse more or less the same APIs between software that handles `ipld://` URLs natively, HTTP gateways like the [IPFS gateway](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/) and CLIs.
With that in mind, there should be a clear mapping between HTTP-like APIs via gateways and URL handlers, and CLI arguments.
In order to make it easier to come to an initial spec, we will focus on a minimal set of features and make subsequent specs with support for features like ADLs, Schemas, and advanced selectors.

## Initial Functionality

The initial functionality focuses on being able to GET and PUT IPLD data to and from a URL.
For now, this will be done by encoding individual blocks of IPLD data using codecs with a default to the [DAG-JSON](https://ipld.io/specs/codecs/dag-json/spec/) codec.
Some initial support for pathing is also included for convenience.

### GET `ipld://{CID}/{Path} Headers {Accept="application/vnd.ipld.dag-json"} => Data`

The most basic mapping is to get some data from a CID.

The `CID` parameter in the URL MUST be in the CIDv1 format or any other format that is not case sensitive.
This is necessary since the URL scheme considers the `hostname` portion to be case-insensitive and many URL parsers (such as the one in Chrome) will automatically convert it to lowercase. 

`Data` is the response body which contaisn the encoded IPLD data for the given CID+Path.
Note that any `Link`s within the IPLD data will not be resolved, and you'll need to conver them to URLs and fetch additional data yourself, or add path segments to the URL to traverse into them.

The `Accept` header may be optionally provided to specify the codec that should be used in the response.
This follows the same conventions as in the [IPFS gateway](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/8758).
Other codecs that may be targetted are DAG-CBOR.
We will need to choose either `application/vnd.ipld.dag-json` or just `application/json` as the dag-json mime type.

The `Path` can be used to specify segments separated by a `/` to use with basic traversal,
if it is supplied the IPLD Node at that location relative to the CID will be returned.
If there path does not lead to a valid IPLD node, an error will be returned instead, e.g. `HTTP 404`.

### PUT `ipld://{CID}/{path} Headers {Content-Type="application/vnd.ipld.dag-json"} Body={encoded IPLD data} => URL`

The `{CID}` should be the "base" CID to extend data from.
Sadly if we are to use URLs, we must have some sort of CID in the hostname.
TODO: Document some inline CIDs to use. IPFS has this empty directory CID `ipfs://bafyaabakaieac` which would be cool to have analogs for for empty `{}` object and `[]` array nodes.

The `Body` of the request should contain the encoded IPLD data you wish to upload.

The `Content-Type` may be optionally provided to specify the encoding of the `Body`.
By default it will be assumed to be `DAG-JSON`.

If a `Path` is specified, intermediate Nodes will be created and added to the Node specified by the CID.
The `Body` will be added as the last node in the chain.
If data already exists at intermediate nodes, it won't be touched other than the final part of the segment.

The response will contain an `ipld://` URL which can then be used with `GET` or subsequent `PUT`s.

### URL to Gateway conversion:

`ipld://` URLs can be converted to standard Gateway URLs by replacing the `ipld://` portion at the beginning with `http://localhost:8080/ipld/` and passing the rest of the request headers and body as is.
Note that gateways may have different root paths than `http://localhost:8080/ipld/`, e.g. `https://ipld.io/ipld/`.

E.g.: `ipld://{CID}/{Path}` => `http://localhost:8080/ipld/{CID}/{Path}`

### URL to CLI

There's no planned CLI for this functionality yet, but a request to a URL might translate to one using something like this:

```
PUT ipld://{CID}/ Headers {Content-Type="application/vnd.ipld.dag-json"} Body="{}"

echo "{}" | ipld-cli put ipld://{CID}/ --content-type="application/vnd.ipld.dag-json"

Or

GET ipld://{CID}/{Path} {Accept="application/vnd.ipld.dag-json} => Data

ipld-cli get ipld://{CID}/{Path} --accept="application/vnd.ipld.dag-json" > myfile.json
```

## Schema

The operations are documented via an IPLD Schema.

```ipld=
// TODO: Is this necessary for v0?
```

## Gotchas

- In order to support `/` inside path segments, it should be escaped using [URI component escaping](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent). This could potentially be used for encoding binary data inside paths, too.

## Initial Implementations TODOs:

- Add a IPLDURL package to [go-ipld-prime/linkin/](https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-prime/tree/master/linking)

## Future work:

- Lenses: ADLs/Schemas
- `PATCH` support
- Selectors
